# Nulaxy-Humidifier-Deflector

This project contains FreeCAD design files and STL files for a fan deflector for the Nulaxy Top Fan Humidifier. With medium-high humidity levels (>40%), the mist can drift downward and be sucked back into the fan intake. To avoid potential damage, this deflector can be 3D printed and placed on the fan output grille.

Note that this redirects the mist stream behind the humidifier, so make sure to leave space behind it.
